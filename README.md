# machine.js

## turn css selectors into state machines


machine.js is a simple plugin that will allow you to treat DOM elements as state machines. you apply the "machine" behavior to any DOM element and that element now has four states : entering, entered, exiting, exited

using this simple principle you can build complex UI interactions such as nested layout managers.
